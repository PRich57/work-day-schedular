# Work Day Schedular

## Description

The purpose of the Work Day Schedular is to help users organize their work days. The schedular has time blocks for each hour from 9am to 5pm. Within each time block, users can type in tasks they have to accomplish, meetings they have to attend, or any other form of reminder to keep themselves organized. When the information is saved in the time block it will remain there until manually removed. If the browser is refreshed or closed and reopened the information will be persistent, so users won't have to worry about missing their deadlines due to lost data!

Another key feature of this web application is the built in color coded indicator system. A green time block indicates a time block is in the future, a red time block indicates the current hour, and a gray time block indicates a past hour.

## Usage

To get started, visit the link in the description above. Upon loading the web application, the user will see the title, a brief description, and the current date and time. The time blocks below are textarea fields where the user can type in tasks or events to plan out their day. To add a task, the user will need to click in any of the rectangular fields to the right of the time frame they would like to add a task or event to. There should be a flashing vertical line in the field indicating the user can now add text to the field. After text has been added, the user will need to click on the blue save icon to the right of the text field. If the save icon is not clicked for any field that has newly altered text, the changes in that field will not be saved. If the user adds or alters text in multiple fields, they must click the save icon for each altered field. The information, once saved, will be persistent. If the page is refreshed or if the browser is closed and reopened, the information last saved will still be on the page as it is pulled directly from the local storage. To clear any text fields, the user must simply click into the text field and erase the text then click the save button again.
